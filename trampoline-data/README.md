# trampoline-data

This module extends functionality that is found in Spring Data JPA.

There is an abstract base entity which has JPA auditing to keep track of creation date,  last updated, etc..

There's also an extension of the JpaRepository to handle our custom abstract entity.

## TODO

- better testing
- softdelete support
