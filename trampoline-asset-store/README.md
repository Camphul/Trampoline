# trampoline-asset-store

Bridge to store assets(blobs, files, images, etc...). Goal is to easily switch between cloud providers(or local storage).

Metadata on assets is stored through JPA(using trampoline-data)

TODO:

- Write tests
- Cleanup code
- Move config to autoconfigure(as much as possible)
